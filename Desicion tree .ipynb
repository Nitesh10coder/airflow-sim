        "### Q&A\n",
        "The Streamlit web application developed allows users to explore Decision Tree Classifiers through the following functionalities:\n",
        "*   **Data Input**: Users can choose to generate synthetic data by configuring parameters such as the number of samples, features, classes, and random state. Alternatively, they can upload their own custom datasets.\n",
        "*   **Feature & Target Selection**: After data input, users can interactively select which columns should be used as features and which column represents the target variable.\n",
        "*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The application enables users to tune key hyperparameters of the Decision Tree Classifier, specifically `max_depth` and `criterion`.\n",
        "*   **Model Training**: The Decision Tree Classifier is trained using the selected data and specified hyperparameters.\n",
        "*   **Performance Metrics**: The performance of the trained model is displayed, including accuracy scores and a classification report.\n",
        "*   **Visualization**: The application provides two main visualizations:\n",
        "    *   The structure of the trained decision tree is visualized.\n",
        "    *   For 2D datasets, decision boundaries are plotted to illustrate how the model classifies different regions of the feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The Streamlit application was successfully initialized, allowing for the setup of a web-based interface for exploring Decision Tree Classifiers.\n",
        "*   **Data Input Flexibility**: The application provides two robust methods for data input:\n",
        "    *   Synthetic data generation: Users can configure parameters like the number of samples (50-1000), features (2-10), classes (2-5), and random state for `make_classification`.\n",
        "    *   Custom dataset upload: Users can upload their own data, facilitating diverse use cases.\n",
        "*   **Interactive Feature Selection**: Users can select target and feature columns from the loaded or generated data, making the app adaptable to different datasets.\n",
        "*   **Hyperparameter Control**: The application allows for direct control over Decision Tree hyperparameters, specifically `max_depth` and `criterion`, enabling users to observe their impact on the model.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Model Evaluation**: The app includes model training and displays key performance metrics such as accuracy and a classification report.\n",
        "*   **Effective Visualizations**: The application includes both a visualization of the decision tree's structure and, for 2D data, decision boundary plots, which are crucial for understanding model behavior.\n",
        "*   During development, the agent successfully resolved a `ModuleNotFoundError` for Streamlit, corrected multiple `SyntaxError` issues arising from incorrect markdown in Python cells, and addressed a `NameError` in the decision boundary visualization by ensuring variable scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   While Streamlit warnings regarding `ScriptRunContext` were frequent during execution in a non-server environment, they did not indicate functional failures of the core Python logic, suggesting the application would run smoothly in a deployed Streamlit environment.\n",
        "*   To further enhance user experience, consider adding more hyperparameter tuning options (e.g., `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`) and potentially expanding visualization capabilities to include feature importance plots or confusion matrices."
